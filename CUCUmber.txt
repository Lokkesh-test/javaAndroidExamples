Behaviour driven development -- BDD_______
>> CUCUmber  is  a BDD framwork tool 
>> CUCUmber is language independent 
      Java. Phython, ruby, C#

>> Create test cases easily by using step 
     description(Simple Text language) (Gherkin)

>>Unknown person such tech and non tech person 
    and managers and stackholder
Approaches :--- 
GIven >>>Some give context ...Precondition 
 When>>> Some Action is performed......Actions
 But>>>> Conjuction of these GIven / When / Then Statement
 Then >>>>> Particular outcome/consequence after the above step (Results).

Reusability of step description in diff scenarios

Parameter to pass we use Example 
Feature file    .feature 
Step description/definition

Junit >>> Open Source >>> its for Java programming 
            language 
>> GUI and test & write source code quick and easily
>> able to build test suite to measure progress of the 
      status while running and 
>> Detect unintended/unexpected side effort
>> Run set of test scenarios and show in red and  
      green bar report (HTML/JSON)
      Index.html
      cucumber.jason
>> So CUCUmber @@ Normal statement and such 
     statemnet will smooth/timely by JUNIT
 >>>> JUNIT Runner class
